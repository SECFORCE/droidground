# Hidden Activity

This is the simplest example ever to showcase basic _DroidGround's_ features.
The target application is downloaded from the [samples](https://github.com/SECFORCE/droidground-samples) and it only contains an "hidden" exported activity that displays the flag.
This "challenge" can be easily solved just by using the "Start Activity" feature in the "Overview" page.

This example also showcases the `DROIDGROUND_BASE_PATH` env variable, which runs DroidGround on a subpath.

Take a look at other examples for more realistic challenges.
