# Hidden Activity

This is the simplest example ever to showcase basic _DroidGround's_ features.
The target application is downloaded from the [samples](https://github.com/SECFORCE/droidground-samples) and it only contains an "hidden" exported activity that displays the flag.
This "challenge" can be easily solved just by using the "Start Activity" feature in the "Overview" page.

Take a look at other examples for more realistic challenges.
